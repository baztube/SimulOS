    <p class="UniqueID358943927p">Hello, fellow internet stranger!
        This project is my "webOS" (not the one from LG tho) It's basically trying to mimic a real operating system
        like
        Windows or MacOS on the web. As you may notice, currently there are not a lot of apps and games to mess
        around
        with. I'm working on a few, so maybe soon there will be more, but if you would like to join our Discord
        server,
        where you will find instructions on how to make the apps and how to "upload them to the OS," By upload, I really 
        meant
        to say send it over to me and wait for me to push a new update of the app library. You can also join the
        Discord
        server to ask questions and check on updates. That's all from me for now, so bye bye ;)</p>
